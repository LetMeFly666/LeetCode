PS F:\OtherApps\Program\Git\Store\Store20_LeetCode> git switch -c dev
Switched to a new branch 'dev'
Your branch and 'origin/dev' have diverged,
and have 9 and 18 different commits each, respectively.
  (use "git pull" if you want to integrate the remote branch with yours)
PS F:\OtherApps\Program\Git\Store\Store20_LeetCode> git switch master
Switched to branch 'master'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
PS F:\OtherApps\Program\Git\Store\Store20_LeetCode> git branch -d dev
warning: not deleting branch 'dev' that is not yet merged to
         'refs/remotes/origin/dev', even though it is merged to HEAD.
error: The branch 'dev' is not fully merged.
If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch -D dev'.
PS F:\OtherApps\Program\Git\Store\Store20_LeetCode> git branch -D dev

PS F:\OtherApps\Program\Git\Store\Store20_LeetCode> git push
fatal: The current branch dev has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin dev

To have this happen automatically for branches without a tracking
upstream, see 'push.autoSetupRemote' in 'git help config'.
