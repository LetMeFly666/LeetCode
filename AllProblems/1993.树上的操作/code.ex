# Your functions will be called as such:
# LockingTree.init_(parent)
# param_1 = LockingTree.lock(num, user)
# param_2 = LockingTree.unlock(num, user)
# param_3 = LockingTree.upgrade(num, user)

# LockingTree.init_ will be called before every test case, in which you can do some necessary initializations.
