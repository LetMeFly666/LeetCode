%% Your functions will be called as such:
%% frequency_tracker_init_(),
%% frequency_tracker_add(Number),
%% frequency_tracker_delete_one(Number),
%% Param_3 = frequency_tracker_has_frequency(Frequency),

%% frequency_tracker_init_ will be called before every test case, in which you can do some necessary initializations.
