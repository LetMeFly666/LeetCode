-spec solution_init_(N :: integer(), Blacklist :: [integer()]) -> any().
solution_init_(N, Blacklist) ->
  .

-spec solution_pick() -> integer().
solution_pick() ->
  .


%% Your functions will be called as such:
%% solution_init_(N, Blacklist),
%% Param_1 = solution_pick(),

%% solution_init_ will be called before every test case, in which you can do some necessary initializations.
