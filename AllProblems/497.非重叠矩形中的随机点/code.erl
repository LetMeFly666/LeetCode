-spec solution_init_(Rects :: [[integer()]]) -> any().

-spec solution_pick() -> [integer()].
solution_pick() ->

%% Your functions will be called as such:
%% solution_init_(Rects),
%% Param_1 = solution_pick(),

%% solution_init_ will be called before every test case, in which you can do some necessary initializations.
