### Gitalk

The theme supports [Gitalk](https://gitalk.github.io/) .
Please refer to [gitalk/readme.md](https://github.com/gitalk/gitalk/blob/master/readme.md) and edit `_config.arknights.yml` in your Hexo directory:  

```yaml
gitalk:
  enable: false
  client_id: # GitHub Application Client ID
  client_secret: # GitHub Application Client Secret
  repo: # GitHub repository
  owner: # GitHub repository owner
  admin: [] # GitHub repository owner and collaborators (Users who having write access to this repository)
            # Example: [adminA,adminB]
  id: # The unique id of the page
      # Example: location.pathname
```

### Waline

The theme supports [Waline](https://waline.js.org/).  
Please refer to [Waline docs](https://waline.js.org/) and edit `_config.arknights.yml` in your Hexo directory

```yaml
waline:
  enable: false 
  server_url: #Server_Url
```

## Mathematical formulas

The theme supports two scenarios for displaying math formulas:  

### Option 1: Static rendering

You can use [hexo-filter-mathjax](https://github.com/next-theme/hexo-filter-mathjax) filter to render math formulas statically:  

1. Run the following commands in your Hexo directory:  

```shell script
# Install hexo-filter-mathjax
cnpm install hexo-filter-mathjax --save
# Clean the cache
hexo clean
```

2. Add the following into `Hexo/_config.yml`:  

```yaml
mathjax:
  tags: none # or 'ams' or 'all'
  single_dollars: true # use single '$' as inline math formula delimiter
  cjk_width: 0.9 # Relatively CJK character width
  normal_width: 0.6 # Relatively normal width
  append_css: true # Add CSS to every pages
  every_page: false # If true, then every page will be rendered by mathjax, regardless of the `mathjax` setting in the front-matter of each article
```

3. Add `mathjax: true` in the [Front-matter](https://hexo.io/docs/front-matter) of article that requires mathjax to be enabled:  

```markdown
---
title: On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies
categories: Physics
date: 1905-06-30 12:00:00
mathjax: true
---
```

Then, you can use LaTeX in your articles.  

4. Please note that inline math formulas (… `$<math formula>$` ...) cannot have spaces after the opening `$` and before the closing `$`! For example:  

```diff
-$ \epsilon_0 $
+$\epsilon_0$
-$ \frac{\partial}{\partial t} $
+$\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$
```

5. Be aware of the conflict between LaTeX and Markdown syntax. Use `\` to escape if necessary:  

```diff
-$\epsilon_0$
+$\epsilon\_0$
-\begin{eqnarray*}
+\begin{eqnarray\*}
```

### Option 2: Dynamic rendering

The theme also supports [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/), to dynamically render formulas as the user browses:

1. First, uninstall the hexo-renderer-marked renderer that comes with Hexo by default, and replace with [hexo-renderer-kramed](https://github.com/sun11/hexo-renderer-kramed) with better MathJax support:  

```shell
npm uninstall hexo-renderer-marked --save
npm install hexo-renderer-kramed --save
```

2. Edit `_config.arknights.yml` in your **Hexo directory**:  

```diff
# Formula support
mathjax:
-  enable: false
+  enable: true
  version: '2.6.1'  # important
```

3. Then, you can use LaTeX in your articles:  

```latex
% Single-line inline formula
% Note that you need to put "`" on both sides, and there can be no space between "`" and "$"
`$\sigma$`

% Multi-line formula
$$
\begin{aligned}f(x) &= \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}{\frac{x}{2^i}} \\
&= x\end{aligned}
$$
```

4. With this scheme, there will be no conflict between LaTeX and Markdown syntax. Escaping is not required to use LaTeX syntax in the text.  
The following formulas can be used directly without any problems:  

```latex
\epsilon_0
\begin{eqnarray*}
```

The hexo-renderer-kramed plugin has other configurable items, please refer to the plugin documentation: https://github.com/sun11/hexo-renderer-kramed  

Advantages and disadvantages of these formula display schemes:  

1. Dynamic rendering does not require escaping, and can better support Markdown files exported from other places. But since it needs to be rendered in the browser, the page display will be slightly delayed.  
2. The static rendering compiles the formula directly into the static file, which has better display performance, but the syntax needs to be escaped.  

## Chart support

Edit `_config.arknights.yml` in your **Hexo directory**:  

```diff
 # Chart support
 mermaid:
-  enable: false
+  enable: true
   version: '8.13.5'
```

The theme renders various charts via mermaid-js. **[Examples](https://ark.theme.yueplus.ink/mermaid/)**

Supports:
[Flow Chart](https://ark.theme.yueplus.ink/mermaid/#%E6%B5%81%E7%A8%8B%E5%9B%BE)
| [Sequence Diagram](https://ark.theme.yueplus.ink/mermaid/#%E5%BA%8F%E5%88%97%E5%9B%BE)
| [Class Diagram](https://ark.theme.yueplus.ink/mermaid/#%E7%B1%BB%E5%9B%BE)
| [State Diagram](https://ark.theme.yueplus.ink/mermaid/#%E7%8A%B6%E6%80%81%E5%9B%BE)
| [Entity Relationship Diagram](https://ark.theme.yueplus.ink/mermaid/#%E5%AE%9E%E4%BD%93%E5%85%B3%E7%B3%BB%E5%9B%BE)
| [User Journey Map](https://ark.theme.yueplus.ink/mermaid/#%E7%94%A8%E6%88%B7%E6%97%85%E7%A8%8B%E5%9B%BE)
| [Gantt Chart](https://ark.theme.yueplus.ink/mermaid/#%E7%94%98%E7%89%B9%E5%9B%BE)
| [Instruction Map](https://ark.theme.yueplus.ink/mermaid/#%E6%8C%87%E4%BB%A4%E5%9B%BE)
| [Pie Chart](https://ark.theme.yueplus.ink/mermaid/#%E9%A5%BC%E5%9B%BE)

Syntax:

```html
<div class="mermaid">
  graph LR
  A[Hard edge] -->|Link text| B(Round edge)
  B --> C{Decision}
  C -->|One| D[Result one]
  C -->|Two| E[Result two]
</div>
```

> It is also fully supported if you are used to using `code blocks`.  

## Word count & Reading time statistics

Depends [`hexo-wordcount`](https://github.com/willin/hexo-wordcount):

For npm users:

```shell script
cnpm install hexo-wordcount --save
```

For yarn users:

```shell script
yarn add hexo-wordcount
```

Then edit `_config.arknights.yml` in your **Hexo directory**:

```yaml
post:
  count: true # Display word count
  time: true # Display reading time statistics
```

## Document encryption

**Note: Front-end encryption is not reliable!**

**Note!** This encryption plugin encrypts the digest content, so it is not possible to hide digests in the body when using this plugin. In `_config.arknights.yaml`:  

```yaml
post:
  excerpt: true # Whether to show digest in the article(contents before <!-- more--> )   <===== cannot be false
```

You can try the [hexo-blog-encrypt](https://github.com/D0n9X1n/hexo-blog-encrypt) plugin for document encryption.  

> Detailed reference: [hexo-blog-encrypt/ReadMe.md](https://github.com/D0n9X1n/hexo-blog-encrypt/blob/master/ReadMe.md)

```sh
cnpm install hexo-blog-encrypt --save
```

Add the following into `Hexo/_config.yml`:  

```yml
# Security
encrypt: # hexo-blog-encrypt
  abstract: Password required for weak neural connection to Rhodes Island™
  message: Please enter password for weak neural connection to Rhodes Island™
  tags:
  - {name: tagName, password: PassowrdA}
  - {name: tagName, password: PasswordB}
  template: <div id="hexo-blog-encrypt" data-wpm="{{hbeWrongPassMessage}}" data-whm="{{hbeWrongHashMessage}}"><div class="hbe-input-container"><input type="password" id="hbePass" placeholder="{{hbeMessage}}" /><label>{{hbeMessage}}</label><div class="bottom-line"></div></div><script id="hbeData" type="hbeData" data-hmacdigest="{{hbeHmacDigest}}">{{hbeEncryptedData}}</script></div>
  wrong_pass_message: Failed to verify password with Rhodes Island™, please try again.
  wrong_hash_message: Failed to validate password with Rhodes Island™, currently viewing with temporary privileges.
```

**Or** Set the following in [Front-matter](https://hexo.io/docs/front-matter) of the artical:  

```markdown
---
title: Hello World
tags:
- Encrypted as a diary
date: 2016-03-30 21:12:21
password: mikemessi
abstract: Password required for weak neural connection to Rhodes Island™
message: Please enter password for weak neural connection to Rhodes Island™
wrong_pass_message: Failed to verify password with Rhodes Island™, please try again.
wrong_hash_message: Failed to validate password with Rhodes Island™, currently viewing with temporary privileges.
---
```

## Searching

Searching is enabled by default. To disable it, edit your `Hexo/_config.arknights.yml` file:

```yaml
search:
  enable: false
```

## Front-matter

In addition to [Front-matter supported by Hexo](https://hexo.io/docs/front-matter), the theme also supports:  

```yaml

| 分支       | 说明                            |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| main     | A relatively stable version    |

### Bugs and solutions that may encounter during development

<!--
#### Modifying the `.pug` template file does not automatically refresh the page.
Workaround: Comment out
`pugRenderer.compile = pugCompile;`
in the file
`./node_modules/hexo-renderer-pug/lib/pug.js`.  
-->

#### Modified TS file does not take effect

This is because after splitting the file, JavaScript is compiled manually instead. Please install `typescript` and run `tsc` in `arknights\source\js` to compile.  

#### Long articles are not fully rendered when running 'hexo serve --debug'

This is caused by `hexo-browsersync`, and will not affect the release.  
Workaround: Just disable this plugin since it doesn't affect the release.
